            <h3 class="subtitle is-size-3">Why Battle for Azeroth Failed</h3>

<p class="content">
  Let me start by saying that I have loved playing WoW for a really long time. I have played the game in a lot 
  of ways and some of the best gaming memories of my life are in this game. I've met a lot of cool people 
  through WoW and started off the beginning of BFA full of optimism and excitement about what the future held 
  after the grand-slam that I viewed Legion as. Unfortunately, much like WoW's apparent subscriber numbers, 
  my optimism and excitement has waned considerably since then.
</p>

<p class="content">
  Many members of the WoW community have voiced their ultimate displeasure about one of BFA's most visible 
  and damning aspect, Azerite Armor. While the problems with Azerite Armor are real I contend that the more 
  serious problems with BFA go deeper than that and are ultimately the result of intentional decisions made 
  by <i>Blizzard</i> developers. 
</p>

<h4 class="subtitle is-size-4">What Blizzard took away</h4>

<div class="content">
  <p>
    Ultimately Blizzard took away a lot from their player base in the transition from Legion to Battle for 
    Azeroth. Although they attempted to replace some of the pieces in BFA their implementation fell well 
    short of giving us back something commensurate to what was taken away.
  </p>
  
  <ul class="with-square-bullets">
    <li>Artifact Traits and Abilities</li>
    <li>Legendaries</li>
    <li>Class Sets</li>
    <li>Added many spells and abilities onto the global cooldown</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    While some of the Artifact traits and legendary effects were baked into existing spells or abilities or 
    turned into talents they were weakened. Or in the case of talents we went from having both the legendary 
    effect AND the talent for that tier to having to choose a neutered legendary effect OR the talent for that 
    tier. Either way you slice it taking away <i>all</i> of these things at the same time resulted in a perceived 
    loss of character power.
  </p>
</div>

<h4 class="subtitle is-size-4">What they gave us in return</h4>

<div class="content">
  <p>
    What we received in return was... Azerite armor. That's <strong>it</strong>. The sole thing responsible for replacing 
    the extreme amount of power taken away from us was the one piece of the system that's despised by the 
    community. 
  </p>
  <p>
    No new talents. No new spells or abilities. Just... Azerite armor.
  </p>
  <p>
    This ultimately led to the feeling that at best your character is stagnate from 110 to 120 and at worst 
    your character actually feels like it <i>regressed</i>. And if there's one rule about RPGS it is that 
    higher level characters should <i>feel</i> significantly higher powered than lower level characters. Beyond 
    the sheer fact of equipping higher item level armor there is no significant difference between a 110 
    character and a 120 character. In a game like WoW, that's a big problem.
  </p>
</div>

<h4 class="subtitle is-size-4">Pray deliver me from RNGesus</h4>

<div class="content">
  <p>
    WoW, at least recently, has had a tremendous reliance on RNG. Since the only way to make your 120 character
    feel more powerful than they were at 110 is through equipping high level armor how you acquire that armor
    becomes more important. Up until very recently the only way to acquire <i>any</i> item is through the luck 
    of the dice roll. They also simultaneously take away 1 of our bonus rolls; knowing that we need multiple 
    pieces of Azerite armor and knowing that we also have to acquire weapons on a regular basis they take 
    away 1 of the best means, through bad luck protection, at actually getting the item that you want. It is 
    incredibly unsatisfying to have an entire week's worth of endgame content result in no items and your 2
    bonus rolls result in meaningless artifact power.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the dev team recognizes this problem in one regard, they recently allow for the purchase of Azerite 
    armor through a special in-game currency, they don't seem able to fully commit to the idea of a currency 
    based loot system; all the other pieces you need still rely on the same RNG system. If items for all slots 
    were able to be purchsed at the very least there is discernible progress made every week toward my character 
    getting better. As it stands right now it is a flip of the coin every week whether or not your character 
    will have <i>any</i> progress made on it. If you get unlucky with the dice rolls and those weeks start numbering 
    3-4 it leaves you feel immensely unsatisfied.
  </p>

<h4 class="subtitle is-size-4">There's still hope...</h4>

<div class="content">
  <p>
    For the next expansion anyway. The dev team also seems to make decisions with the sole intent of making the 
    game less fun; adding affixes to all M+ keys and destroying the low level key ecosystem, not having paragon 
    reputation from the beginning, time-gating allied races while simultaneously marketing them as a key feature 
    of the expansion, not allowing reputation tokens to be shared across alts, and simply neutering the items 
    in world treasure chests were all conscious decisions whose seemingly only impact is to make the game less 
    enjoyable and to take away from the player base. It will take time to reverse course, if the dev team ever 
    decides to, and given the current state of Blizzard it does not seem as if that faith is well placed.
